# Hexagonal Architecture in Java Tutorial

This repository contains a sample Java REST application implemented according to hexagonal architecture.

# Architecture Overview

The source code is separated into four modules:
* `model` - contains the domain model
* `application` - contains the domain services and the ports of the hexagon
* `adapters` - contains the REST, in-memory and JPA adapters
* `boostrap` - contains the configuration and bootstrapping logic

The following diagram shows the hexagonal architecture of the application along with the source code modules:
